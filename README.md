# 👋🏾 Hi, I'm Eric Maina

I'm a frontend-heavy fullstack developer based in Kenya `(254)` focused on building fast, accessible, and beautiful websites. Basically, I make things work and look good doing it.

I care a lot about performance, clean design, and not wasting users’ time—or mine. My stack leans into **JavaScript frameworks** like Next.js, with a growing relationship (situationship?) with **Python** 🐍. We don’t label it.

## 🛠 Latest Project: Toast or Ghost

[**Toast or Ghost**](https://github.com/exuseric/toast-or-ghost) — A slick RSVP management app built with **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **Postgres (via Xata)**.

It’s for event organizers who want clean UX and less ghosting. Create events, send branded invites, and track RSVPs in real time. Attendees can RSVP in two clicks and update responses later—because people change their minds more than their socks.

## 🧪 Other Notable Builds

**[BookMeMaybe](https://github.com/exuseric/bookmemaybe)** — A booking platform for solo service providers (tutors, dog walkers, life coaches... yeah, even them). Build a custom booking page, manage availability, and accept payments. Crying optional.

- **Built with:** Next.js · Clerk · Postgres

## 🧠 What I'm Into Right Now

- Smoothing out UI & UX for actual human beings
- Playing around with Astro, Pocketbase, and other shiny tools
- Maybe getting serious with Angular, maybe not. Stop asking.

## 🧰 I’ve Worked With

- Shopify (storefront builds)
- Astro (for lightning-fast landers)
- Supabase, Pocketbase, and a pinch of Postgres in everything
- Solo, in teams, and for agencies that send too many Slack messages
