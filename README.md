# 👋 Hi, I'm Eric

I’m a **Full-Stack Developer** based in Nairobi. I build web systems with a bias toward **performance, clarity, and "boring-but-correct" solutions.** I’m drawn to tools that reward curiosity and systems that punish sloppy thinking.

---

## Philosophy & Approach

* **Clarity over Cleverness:** Code should be readable today and maintainable in six months.
* **Performance as a Constraint:** Fast load times and low latency are design requirements, not afterthoughts.
* **Earned Abstractions:** I prefer predictable data flow over "magic" frameworks that hide complexity.
* **Iterative Learning:** I believe confusion is a signal for where a system needs better modeling.

## Tech Stack

I care less about labels and more about *why* a tool exists and where it fails under pressure.

| Category | Tools of Choice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3/Tailwind |
| **Frontend** | React, Next.js, Astro |
| **Backend & Infra** | Node.js, Cloudflare Workers (Edge), RESTful APIs |
| **Data & Storage** | PostgreSQL, Supabase |
| **CMS & E-commerce** | Payload CMS, Shopify (Liquid/Storefront API), WordPress |
| **Testing/Ops** | Vitest, Cypress, Docker, GitHub Actions |

## Selected Work

* **High-Performance Marketing Platforms** – Architecting Astro + Headless CMS setups optimized for Core Web Vitals and SEO.
* **Serverless Edge Middleware** – Using Cloudflare Workers for real-time inventory synchronization and API decoupling.
* **E-commerce Ecosystems** – Developing custom Shopify workflows, analytics pipelines, and CRM automation.
* **Resilient Design Systems** – Building "boring" reusable components that prioritize accessibility and stability.

## Currently Exploring

* Mobile development with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and Compose Multiplatform
* Advanced frontend architecture patterns and their long-term trade-offs.
* Distributed systems fundamentals and edge computing.
* Enhanced observability and data-flow reasoning.
